# Project Context — Agentic Watershed

Living document. Update this as the project evolves so coding agents and
collaborators can pick up where things left off without needing the full
conversation history.

## Current deployment state

Running on a Raspberry Pi 5, Napa, California.
All stacks deployed under `/home/cprice/Agentic/`.

### Collectors — all running via cron

| Stack | Frequency | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Watershed | every 15 min | ✅ Running, storing to `watershed.db` |
| Weather | every 30 min | ✅ Running, storing to `weather.db` |
| AQI | every 30 min | ✅ Running, storing to `aqi.db` |

### Domain agents — all running via cron

| Stack | Schedule | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Watershed | 0,6,12,18h | ✅ Running, writing observations |
| Weather | 1,7,13,19h | ✅ Running, writing observations |
| AQI | 2,8,14,20h | ✅ Running, writing observations |

### Synthesis agent

| Schedule | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 6h, 18h | ✅ Running live (not dry-run), writing to `synthesis.db` |

Accumulating domain observations — first meaningful cross-domain synthesis
expected after 2-3 days of data. Baseline established on first run (2026-06-22):
low fire risk, no flood risk, low AQI risk. Marine influence dominant.

## Environment

```
Pi OS: Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
Python: 3.11+
All stacks use independent venvs at <stack>/.venv/
Environment variables set in /etc/environment, sourced in cron via `. /etc/environment`
```

Required environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — used by all agents
- `AIRNOW_API_KEY` — used by AQI collector and agent

---

## Known issues / notes

- AirNow API occasionally returns empty responses — collector logs a warning and retries next poll. Normal behaviour, not a bug.
- USGS qualifiers are returned as plain strings not dicts — fixed in collector.py (parse_usgs_response).
- Weather and AQI venvs needed to be created separately from Watershed — each stack is fully independent.
- `/etc/environment` is not loaded automatically by cron — sourced explicitly with `. /etc/environment &&` prefix on each cron line.

## What's next

### Immediate
- [ ] Let data accumulate (2-3 days) before evaluating synthesis quality
- [ ] Monitor synthesis observations for cross-domain reasoning quality

### Next feature: ATProto / Bluesky publisher
When `flagged=true` in a synthesis observation, post `summary` to Bluesky.
- The `summary` field in synthesis output is already written for a public audience
- Need to: register an ATProto DID for the agent, design the lexicon, build publisher
- Planned lexicon: `com.napavalley.monitor.observation`
- Publisher should be a separate process that reads `synthesis.db` and posts when flagged

### Future: Distributed identity exploration
- Move Synthesis agent to a separate device
- Run domain MCP servers in HTTP mode (`--http` flag already implemented, ports 8000/8001/8002)
- Explore workload identity: who is allowed to call a domain agent's MCP tools?
- Candidate approaches: SPIFFE/SVID, PKI/X.509, charter-based authorisation
- This is the bridge to the Ping Identity identity/trust work

### Possible additions
- AQI publisher to add more domain agents (separate Pi nodes upvalley)
- Physical sensors via Pi GPIO → same collector interface, no agent changes needed
- Additional USGS stations (Conn Creek, Milliken Creek tributaries)

## Architecture decisions made

**Why separate venvs per stack?** Independence — each stack can be updated,
restarted, or replaced without affecting the others.

**Why MCP servers as stdio subprocesses?** Simplicity at this scale. Each
agent spawns the MCP server per tool call rather than running it persistently.
Switching to persistent HTTP is one flag (`--http`) when needed.

**Why does Synthesis read SQLite directly instead of via MCP?**
Domain agent observations are already clean, structured conclusions.
No need for the MCP abstraction layer when reading conclusions rather than raw data.
This will change when Synthesis moves to a separate device.

**Why Sonnet for Synthesis, Haiku for domain agents?**
Cross-domain reasoning across multiple observation sets warrants more capability.
Domain agents do single-domain threshold assessment — Haiku is sufficient and cheaper.

**Why are agents cron-triggered rather than long-running?**
Simpler, more robust, easier to debug. A failed run doesn't affect the next one.
Statelessness is a feature — memory is explicit via the observations tables.
